# TMDb-Movie-Data
This project dives into a dataset provided by The Movie Database (TMDb) on thousands of different movies. 
The various properties associated with movies are visualized using multiple different plots to identify patterns in the data
and answer the key question.

## Key Question

_What properties are associated with highly rated movies?_

## Data Wrangling & Cleaning

The dataset is loaded into a dataframe from the file called *tmdb-movies.csv*. The data is inspected and cleaned for analysis. Duplicate rows and irrelevant columns are removed, variables are renamed, and null values are dropped. 

## Tools

* tmdb-movies.csv
* Python
* Jupyter notebook
